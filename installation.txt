Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Apache
	mod_rewrite

	We use mod_rewrite to provide human readable URLs.  This is set
	in either an httpd.conf file, or in a .htaccess file

Framework:
	This application requires our Framework to be on the server somewhere.
	Our Framework is available as a seperate release.  In the configuration,
	you will need to point this scaffolding to the directory where the
	Framework is installed.

ZendFramework
	The search engine has been built using the ZendFramework.  You will
	need that installed on the webserver.  ZendFramework is available at
	http://framework.zend.com

HTMLPurifier
	Content is cleaned using HTMLPurifier, a standards-compliant
  	HTML filter library written in PHP.  HTMLPurifier is available at
  	http://htmlpurifier.org

PHP:
	PHP must be compiled with support for:
		PDO
		MySQL
		LDAP
		Browscap

	Actually, you can substitute any database support for MySQL, as our
	framework uses PDO for database interaction.

MySQL:
	MySQL should have support for InnoDB.  Foreign keys are written into
	the database load scripts.  While MyISAM tables will just ignore them,
	you database and your application will be that much more robust with InnoDB
	support.

	Currently MySQL is the only database supported.  Content Manager is
	written expecting MySQL's fulltext indexing. Also, backups and
	restores are implemented using the mysql and mysqldump executables
	via exec()

LDAP:
	LDAP is only used for doing LDAP authentication for users.
	If you're not going to do any LDAP authentication, you can delete or
	comment out the LDAP stuff.

Browscap
	Browser checking functions are enabled by default in PHP, so there's
	no compilation flags needed.
	However; you do need to install download a copy of browscap.ini and
	point to it with the browscap setting in php.ini.

	You can download the latest version of browscap.ini from:
	http://browsers.garykeith.com/downloads.asp

Subversion:
	Content is versioned using subversion.  You will need subversion
	installed on your webserver, so that PHP can call the svn commands
	to keep track of the documents.

	The repository does not have to be located on the webserver,
	however, in our case, we just create the repository inside the
	web application directory once it's installed.

ImageMagick
	Images in the content manager are resized as necessary.  This is done
	in PHP, using exec() calls to ImageMagick's collection programs.

	Most Linux distributions include ImageMagick.  If yours does not, or,
	if you're on Windows, you can download ImageMagick from:
	http://www.imagemagick.org

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	Put the web application somewhere accessible by Apache.

	All of the application's settings are set in configuration.inc.
The best way is to have PHP auto_prepend the configuration.inc.
If this is the only web application on your apache server, you can just point
your apache's web directory to the html directory inside the application and
edit the auto_prepend in your php.ini file.

	For us, we're running multiple applications, and have a seperate entry in
our Apache config for each one.  This does essentially the same thing.

	We also need to allow for large file uploads.  Two other PHP.ini values
need to be set, post_max_size and max_uploaded_file.  For our purposes, we
put these PHP.ini settings inside of the Apache httpd.conf, along with the
auto_prepend.

	We use Apache's mod_rewrite to allow human readable URLs.  Any incoming
url that doesn't match something on the site is sent to 404.php.  Make sure
Apache is using the correct URL for the document.  It doesn't need the
server portion, though.  So the leading slash means root of the webserver.
It should start with whatever Alias you're using for the site.


Add to httpd.conf:

Alias /application_name "/path/to/application_name/html"
<Directory "/path/to/application_name/html">
    Options FollowSymLinks
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all

	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteRule !^($|404.php|home.php|tree.js|backups|calendars|departments|documents|documentTypes|editors|events|facets|locations|login|media|sections|skins|users|widgets) /content_manager/404.php

	php_value auto_prepend_file /path/to/application_name/configuration.inc
	php_value post_max_size 100M
	php_value upload_max_filesize 100M
</Directory>


	If you're running in a shared hosting environment, you cannot do Alias or
Directory commands.  However the html can be moved into your web directory.
To make sure the configuration file gets loaded, create an htaccess file in
this application's html directory with the php_value line from above.

	If you cannot edit your httpd.conf or use htaccess files, you will need to
add an include() command to the top of every last PHP script in the html directory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------------
	Edit configuration.inc with appropriate values for your installation.


---------------------------------------------------------------------
Prepare Non-Database Data
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Install Subversion repository:
	This application uses subversion to track changes to the documents.
	You will need to set up a repository that PHP can checkout and commit to.
	Typically you just create the repository in the application's data
	directory once it's installed.

	1) Create the document_repository
	cd /path/to/application/data
	svnadmin create repository

	2) Import the default homepage into the document_repository
	cd documents
	svn import file:///path/to/application/data/repository -m 'Initial repository population.'

	3) Check the default documents out of the repository
	cd ..
	rm -Rf documents
	svn checkout file:///path/to/application/data/repository documents



Install Search Engine:
	This application uses a search index stored on the hard drive.
	You will need to install the index, then set permissions so that
	PHP has read/write permissions to the search index.

	cd /path/to/application/scripts
	php install_search.php

Create Symbolic links to media directories in Data
	cd /path/to/application/html/media
	ln -s ../../data/media/attachment/
	ln -s ../../data/media/image/

Set Permissions:
	The data directory is where the application stores all non-database
	information.  You will need to make sure that the webserver has read/write
	permissions to everything in this directory

	cd /path/to/application
	chown -R apache data
	chmod -R u+rw data
