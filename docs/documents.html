<h1>Documents</h1>
<p>
	Documents are created and maintained by a specific department.
	Just like newspapers or magazine articles, documents contain headings and titles and a body of information.
	Documents may also contain pictures, attachments, tables, lists, links, etc.
</p>

<h2>Document Types</h2>
<p>
	Document types specify the type of information being given:
	minutes for a meeting, a news release, generic information.
	Most documents are simply going to fall under the default document type: "webpage".
</p>
<p>
	Specifying that a document is a particular type allows for special treatment.
	For example, document types like minutes, agendas and news could be sorted chronologically by their publish date,
	where document types webpages, services, and others could be sorted alphabetically.
</p>

<h2>Metadata (Titles, Descriptions, etc.)</h2>
<p>
	A document's metadata is all the information beyond its content that enables the document to be categorized.
	This information includes the document's title, description, publish and retire dates,
	alias, action title and the department which the document belongs to.
	All of this metadata is used behind the scenes by our system and by other internet applications for a variety of functions:
</p>

<h2>Featuring a Document</h2>
<p>
	Documents can be featured on the homepages of the sections in which the document is found.
	Featured Documents appear in a specific featured place on the homepage, and will be grouped by document type.
</p>

<h2>Facets</h2>
<p>
	By assigning facets to documents, the system can enable end users to find information in new ways.
	The facets available to use are chosen by the web master.
</p>

<h2>Body or Content</h2>
<p>
	The body of a webpage is the actual information to be conveyed.
	In a magazine or newspaper, the body would be the article.
</p>
<h3>Headings</h3>
<p>
	Many people in the community that are visually impaired rely on headers in web content to navigate webpages.
	They are essential for creating website accessible to all people.
	To be compliant with standard internet accessibility guidelines, we encourage the use of headings to organize content.
</p>

<h2>Related Links Widget</h2>
<p>
	Use Related Links as a resource for consolidating links to relevant external websites.
</p>
<p>
	Some links can be integrated into both the content of the document, as well as the Related Links widget.
	The related links widget should be reserved for secondary information, since the actual content of the document is most important.
