	<h1>Backups</h1>
	<p>
		Setting up automated backups involves editing and installing a CRON script.
		Information on the backup CRON script is on the Post-Install page.
		The provided CRON script if the optimum way to ensure backups.
		In the script, you can adjust how many days of tarballs to keep.
		The script will delete tarballs older than the number of days you specify.
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also manually create a backup snapshot by logging in as an Administrator.
		As an admin, you have access to the Backups page.
		Just click on the 'Add' button to create a new snapshot of that point in time.
		Large sites could take a while to create the tarball.
		If you are doing this from the web browser, make sure to give it enough time to complete.
		As the site grows, you may need to adjust the MAX_EXECUTION_TIME for the /html/backups/create.php script.
	</p>

	<h2>Restoring</h2>
	<p>
		The backup tarballs are stored in /backups.
		In the event of a catastrophe, you can do a full restore from any of these tarballs.
		Each backup contains the full data directory, including a mysqldump file from that point in time.
		To restore:
	</p>
	<ul><li>Uncompress the tarball</li>
		<li>Put the uncompressed data directory in place (replacing/removing any old data directory)</li>
		<li>Drop the database and recreate it using the database.sql</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Restoring individual documents</h3>
	<p>
		Most often you will need to only restore individual documents, rather than doing a full restore.
		This happens as users tend to inadvertantly delete or replace live documents.
		Once you've uncompressed a backup tarball, you can copy an individual document file to the live data directory to restore it.
	</p>
	<p>
		The database only contains meta-data about the documents.
		The actual contents of the documents are stored as files on the filesystem in /data/documents.
		To avoid dumping all the document files into a single directory, the files are organized by "Created" date.
		Currently to restore an individual document you will need to look up it's created date in the database.
		If the document has been deleted, and you're trying to restore it,
		you will need to create a temporary database for the backup data and populate it using the database.sql from the tarball.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you have the "Created" date, you just copy the document file(s)
		from the uncompressed data to the live data directory.
		The files are stored in /data/documents/$year/$mon/$day/$id.lang.
	</p>
	<p>
		Multiple language versions of the same document are stored in the same directory
		using the ID of the document as the filename, and the language code as the extension.
