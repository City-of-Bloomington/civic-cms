	<h1>Civic Website Manager</h1>
	<p>
		This is the content manager originally developed for the City of Bloomington, Indiana.
		You can see it in action at <a href="http://bloomington.in.gov">http://bloomington.in.gov</a>.
		It addresses several needs of the local government that weren't met by bigger, existing CMS, like Drupal and Joomla.
	</p>
	<p>
		Government organizations have a large amount of information to make public
		and a small number of employees to make it happen. Updating a website has to
		be a painless process for the people responsible for posting the information.
		This content manager accomplished that for the City of Bloomington.
	</p>

	<h2>Top Down Control</h2>
	<p>
		A webmaster creates the site layout and assigns departments of users to sections of the site.
		This allows users to focus on posting and editing content just for their own sections.
		The webmaster can maintain a very large site structure while keeping the system easy for people to post content.
	</p>

	<h2>Custom Content</h2>
	<p>
		The city didn't need a blog. It needed a way to post meeting minutes, agendas, ordinances, etc.
		All the document types in the content manager are custom defined by the webmaster.
		You're not stuck with the types of content the system ships with.
		In fact, the only type that comes predefined is a generic "webpage" type.
	</p>

	<h2>Simple, Secure Code</h2>
	<p>
		Everyone needs something a little different. This project is written in PHP 5
		taking advantage of the the new SPL iterators. Built using an MVC framework,
		the project is well organized and easy to understand.
		Developers will have no trouble customizing the application to meet new needs.
