<h1>Post-Installation Setup</h1>
<p>
	Once you've gone through the installation instructions, your new website is functional.
	Right away, though, you will want to change the administrator's user account
	information from the default values.
</p>

<h2>Change the Admin Account</h2>
<p>
	After install, you can log in as user=administrator, pass=welcome.
	You will immediately want to change these values once you've logged in for the first time.
	The system will not work without at least one user in the system;
	so, you cannot delete the administrator account, but you can change all of
	it's information to whatever you want to log in as.
</p>

<h2>CRON scripts</h2>
<p>
	The content manager ships with several bash scripts suitable for cron or command line usage.
	Before using them, however, they all need to be modified to provide appropriate path information for your install.
	Once these scripts are edited and set to be executable, they can be used in CRON.
	Typically, this means adding the file to /etc/cron.daily.
</p>

<h2>Backups</h2>
<p>
	The system provides support for automated backups.
	Each backup will be a snapshot tarball of the database and data directory.
</p>
<h3>Edit /scripts/backup</h3>
<ul><li>set the path to the application</li>
    <li>set the path to mysqldump</li>
	<li>provide the mysql authentication information</li>
	<li>set the number of days worth of backups to keep</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Once it's executable you can add it to your systems' /etc/cron.daily.
	Because the script needs mysql username and password information,
	be sure to set the permissions on the script to readable only by root.
</p>

<h2>Search Engine Indexing</h2>
<h3>Edit /scripts/index_search</h3>
<ul><li>Set the path to PHP</li>
	<li>Set the path to your installation of Content Manager</li>
	<li>Set user that Apache runs as</li>
</ul>
