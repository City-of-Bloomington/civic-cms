<h1>Creating Links</h1>
<p>
	Links in the system are created using a custom syntax. It is generally of the form of:
</p>
<code>
[target]
or
[link text|target]
</code>

<p>
	Where "target" is the thing you are linking to,
	and "link text" is any custom text to be displayed.
	The "link text" portion is not required.
</p>
<p>
	In the following examples "link text|" is not required.
	If you leave this off, then the system will use the title of the page/content for the text of your link.
</p>

<h2>External Links</h2>
<p>Links to URLs outside of the web server. You can use full URLs.</p>
<code>
[link text|full URL of external webpage]
[Monroe County|http://www.co.monroe.in.us]
</code>

<h2>Relative Links</h2>
<p>
	To link to website content on the same server,
	but not contained in the content manager application, you can use relative URLs.
	The URL must start with a slash, "/", signifying the root of the webserver.
</p>
<code>
[link text|/path to file from website root]
[Community Profile|/profile.php]
</code>


<h2>Email Address</h2>
<code>
[link text|mailto:email@address.com]
[Click to email John Smith|mailto:johnsmith@gmail.com]
</code>

<h2>Create an Anchor</h2>
<code>
[anchor:somename]
[anchor:section2]
</code>

<h2>Create a Link to that Anchor</h2>
<code>
[link text|#section2]
</code>

<h2>Internal Links</h2>
<p>
	Links to content contained in the content manager.
	Items in the content manager can be linked to directly:
</p>

<h3>Documents (links to a page within the site)</h3>
<p>
	You can link to any document in the system by Title, Alias, or ID number.
	Document links do not need a prefix on the target portion.
</p>
<code>
[link text|document]
or just
[document]

Examples:
[The homepage of the ITS department|Information and Technology Services]
[The homepage of the ITS department|ITS]
[The homepage of the ITS department|32]

[Information and Technology Services]
[ITS]
[32]
</code>

<h3>Media</h3>
<p>
	You can link to any media in the system by filename or by ID number.
	The media does not have to be attached to a document to be able to create a link to the media.
	Media links use a prefix, "file:" on the target portion.
</p>
<code>
[link text|file:media]
or just
[file:media]

Examples:
[2007-08-01 Plan Commission Minutes|file:pcminutes_20070801.pdf]
[2007-08-01 Plan Commission Minutes|file:6]

[file:pcminutes_20070801.pdf]
[file:6]
</code>

<h3>Locations</h3>
<p>
	You can create a link to a Location by name or by ID number.
	Links to locations use "location:" in the target portion.
</p>
<code>
[link text|location:location]
or just
[location:location]

Examples:
[The Animal Shelter|location:Animal Shelter]
[The Animal Shelter|location:12]

[location:Animal Shelter]
[location:12]
</code>

<h3>Location Groups</h3>
<p>
	You can create a link to the group of locations by name or by ID number.
	Links to location groups use "locationGroup:" in the target portion.
</p>
<code>
[link text|locationGroup:group]
or just
[locationGroup:group]

Examples:
[City Parks|locationGroup:Parks]
[City Parks|locationGroup:1]

[locationGroup:Parks]
[locationGroup:1]
</code>

<h3>Calendars</h3>
<p>
	You can link to whole calendars by name or ID number.
	Links to calendars use "calendar:" in the target portion.
</p>
<code>
[link text|calendar:calendar]
or just
[calendar:calendar]

Examples:
[The City Government Calendar|calendar:Government]
[The City Government Calendar|calendar:3]

[calendar:Government]

</code>

<h3>Events</h3>
<p>
	You can link to events by name or ID number.
	Since events can be recurring events, you can link to a specific instance of an event by including the date as well.
	Links to events use "event:" in the target portion.
</p>
<code>
[link text|event:event]
[link text|event:date/event]
or just

</code>

<h3>Facets</h3>
<p>
	You can link to a facet by name or ID number.
	Links to facets use "facet:" in the target portion.
